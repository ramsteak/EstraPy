# Commands

EstraPy reads instructions from an input file, which defines the operations to perform.
These operations include loading experimental data, applying transformations, generating plots, and exporting results.
Each instruction is written as a command, which follows a simple and consistent syntax.

Commands are executed in the order they appear in the file, and many commands support multiple options for customization.
The syntax and usage of each command are detailed in the sections below.
